# 100 Days Of ML/DL Code

### Day 0: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched [Siraj Raval's music generation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DMm5Lhey1U&t=307s), learning how to create music using deep learning. I learned more about LSTM's, but couldn't get the code running on my end.

**Thoughts:** The video was difficult to understand and I couldn't get all that I wanted out of it. I did, however, understand how LSTM layers work and know how I would use them.

**Link to work:** No work produced today. I hope to get into creating a music generator.

### Day 1: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched [Jordan Boyd-Graber's video on intro to ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DjSOLW-ozc&list=PLegWUnz91WfsELyRcZ7d1GwAVifDaZmgo&index=1), learning about the basics of machine learning and the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm.
I also created the beginnings of a program that uses ML algorithms to predict whether a person will donate blood again or not. I am completing [this challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations/page/5/) for my first project.

**Thoughts:** One thing in the video that was interesting was that Jordan said that everything is data, including our genome and the brain itself.
I got to learn about pandas, numpy, and reading in data from a csv and parsing it into the data needed to feed it to a ML algorithm. I have a decent understanding
of this process, but doing it myself and looking up the documentation will help me in the future to understand how the process works of getting data to fit and train models and then
predictingh the labels based off of that input.
