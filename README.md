# 100 Days Of ML/DL Code

## The vlog accompanying this challenge can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-XdamS0-zw&list=PLnXc6tX6p6dbBVtb-B_OgAodhQoBBOWrx&index=1).

### Day 1: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched [Siraj Raval's music generation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DMm5Lhey1U&t=307s), learning how to create music using deep learning. I learned more about LSTM's, but couldn't get the code running on my end.

**Thoughts:** The video was difficult to understand and I couldn't get all that I wanted out of it. I did, however, understand how LSTM layers work and know how I would use them.

**Link to work:** No work produced today. I hope to get into creating a music generator.

### Day 2: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched [Jordan Boyd-Graber's video on intro to ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DjSOLW-ozc&list=PLegWUnz91WfsELyRcZ7d1GwAVifDaZmgo&index=1), learning about the basics of machine learning and the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm.
I also created the beginnings of a program that uses ML algorithms to predict whether a person will donate blood again or not. I am completing [this challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations/page/5/) for my first project.

**Thoughts:** One thing in the video that was interesting was that Jordan said that everything is data, including our genome and the brain itself.
I got to learn about pandas, numpy, and reading in data from a csv and parsing it into the data needed to feed it to a ML algorithm. I have a decent understanding
of this process, but doing it myself and looking up the documentation will help me in the future to understand how the process works of getting data to fit and train models and then
predictingh the labels based off of that input.

# Day 3: July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the blood prediction project from yesterday, I made a file that reads in the data to a Logistic Regreession algorithm and it outputs the probabilities to a CSV file. I submitted the file and scored #1430 out of #4650. Not bad for such a basic algorithm!

**Thoughts:** I feel really confident with my skills after placing that high. I looked up all of the documentation and it gave me the feeling of control and understanding of what I was doing. Obviously this project was super simple, but I now know with certainty that I have the basics down. It really is easy to get a ML algorithm up and going. I want to extend this program to use deep learning techniques and get more practice with that, because I feel much less comfortable with DL libraries, functions, and architectures.

# Day 4: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I narrowed down the program to use only one algorithm - logistic regression. I then implemented GridSearchCV to select the best parameters for the job.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed refining my solution and using GridSearchCV. I'm going to now move onto using deep learning and switch to a new project.

# Day 5: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started on a [new kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer), and am [following this tutorial that creates a deep neural net using keras](https://www.kaggle.com/poonaml/deep-neural-network-keras-way). I got about halfway through the tutorial today.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot through doing this kernel. It taught me a lot about keras and how to use it. I thought it was pretty easy to begin making a neural net (compared to tensorflow). Walking through the tutorial and trying to explain everything on the vlog forced me to think through everthing and taught me a lot. I feel much more confident in creating a neural net than I did before I started.
